# Cancer-Detection-Screener
Udacity Deep Learning mini project

This is a blog of my attempts to create a model for detecting skin cancers.
I'll add to it as I make changes but for right now, I'm just getting started
figuring out how to work in Jupyter notebooks without my Udacity workspace....
I ripped off my training wheels before realizing I don't know how to ride
a bike yet.....wheeeeeeee
